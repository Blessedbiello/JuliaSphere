## Overview

JuliaOS is a comprehensive framework for building decentralized applications (DApps) with a focus on agent-based architectures, swarm intelligence, and cross-chain operations. It provides both a CLI interface for quick deployment and a framework API for custom implementations. By leveraging AI-powered agents and swarm optimization, JuliaOS enables sophisticated strategies across multiple blockchains.

    * Fork the [JuliaOS repository](https://github.com/Juliaoscode/JuliaOS) to your own GitHub account.
    * Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature` or `fix/bug-description`).
    * Make your changes, adhering to any coding style guidelines (to be defined, see below).
    * Write or update tests for your changes.
    * Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
    * Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
    * Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` or appropriate development branch of the `Juliaoscode/JuliaOS` repository.
    * Clearly describe the changes in your PR and link to any relevant issues.
    * Be responsive to feedback and participate in the review process.

### Contribution Guidelines (To Be Established)

We are in the process of formalizing our contribution guidelines. In the meantime, please aim for:
