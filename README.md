## Overview

JuliaOS is a comprehensive framework for building decentralized applications (DApps) with a focus on agent-based architectures, swarm intelligence, and cross-chain operations. It provides both a CLI interface for quick deployment and a framework API for custom implementations. By leveraging AI-powered agents and swarm optimization, JuliaOS enables sophisticated strategies across multiple blockchains.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Julia**: Ensure you have Julia installed. You can download it from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/).
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Creating Agents and Swarms (TypeScript & Python)

#### TypeScript (TS) Agents & Swarms

1. **Install dependencies and build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create a new agent or swarm using the provided templates:**
   - Copy and customize the template in `packages/modules/julia_templates/custom_agent_template.jl` for Julia-based agents.
   - For TypeScript agents, use the templates in `packages/templates/agents/` (e.g., `custom_agent_template.jl`, `src/AgentsService.ts`).

3. **Configure your agent or swarm:**
   - Edit the configuration files or pass parameters in your TypeScript code.
   - Use the TypeScript SDK (`packages/core/src/api/ApiClient.ts`) to interact with the Julia backend, create agents, submit objectives, and manage swarms.

4. **Run your agent or swarm:**
   - Use the CLI or your own script to start the agent.
   - Example (TypeScript):
     ```typescript
     import { ApiClient } from '@juliaos/core';
     const client = new ApiClient();
     // Create and run agent logic here
     ```

#### Python Agents & Swarms

1. **Install the Python wrapper:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ./packages/pythonWrapper
   ```

2. **Create a new agent or swarm using the Python templates:**
   - Use the templates in `packages/templates/python_templates/` (e.g., `orchestration_template.py`, `llm_integration_examples/`).

3. **Configure and run your agent:**
   - Import the Python wrapper and use the client to interact with JuliaOS.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from juliaos_wrapper import client
     api = client.JuliaOSApiClient()
     # Create and run agent logic here
     ```

4. **Submit objectives or manage swarms:**
   - Use the Python API to submit objectives, create swarms, and monitor results.

## Architecture Overview

JuliaOS is built as a modular, multi-layered system for cross-chain, agent-based, and swarm intelligence applications. The architecture is designed for extensibility, security, and high performance, supporting both EVM and Solana ecosystems.

**Key Layers:**

- **User Logic & SDKs**
  - **TypeScript SDK & Logic Layer:**  
    - Location: `packages/core/`, `packages/templates/agents/`
    - Users write agent and swarm logic in TypeScript, using the SDK to interact with the Julia backend.
  - **Python Wrapper/SDK & Logic Layer:**  
    - Location: `packages/pythonWrapper/`, `packages/templates/python_templates/`
    - Users write agent and orchestration logic in Python, using the wrapper to interact with JuliaOS.

- **JuliaOS Backend**
  - **Layer 1: Julia Core Engine (Foundation Layer):**  
    - Location: `julia/src/`
    - Implements core backend logic: agent orchestration, swarm algorithms, neural networks, portfolio optimization, blockchain/DEX integration, price feeds, storage, and trading strategies.
  - **Layer 2: Julia API Layer (Interface Layer, MCP-Enabled):**  
    - Location: `julia/src/api/`
    - Exposes all backend functionality via API endpoints (REST/gRPC/MCP), validates and dispatches requests, formats responses, and enforces API-level security.
  - **Layer 3: Rust Security Component (Specialized Security Layer):**  
    - Location: `packages/rust_signer/`
    - Handles all cryptographic operations (private key management, transaction signing, HD wallet derivation) in a secure, memory-safe environment, called via FFI from Julia.

- **DEX Integrations**
  - Modular DEX support for Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, QuickSwap, TraderJoe (EVM), and Raydium (Solana) via dedicated modules in `julia/src/dex/`.
  - Each DEX module implements the AbstractDEX interface for price, liquidity, order creation, trade history, and token/pair discovery.

- **Risk Management & Analytics**
  - Global risk management is enforced via `config/risk_management.toml` and `julia/src/trading/RiskManagement.jl`.
  - Real-time trade logging and analytics are provided by `julia/src/trading/TradeLogger.jl`, outputting to both console and file.

- **Community & Contribution**
  - Open-source, community-driven development with clear contribution guidelines and modular extension points for new agents, DEXes, and analytics.
