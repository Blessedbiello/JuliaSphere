# JuliaOS Python Modules

The `juliaos` Python module is intended to provide a way of interacting with a JuliaOS backend, enabling users to control their agents through a Python script.

## Development

Requires Python 3.11+.

First, optionally, set up and activate your venv here in the `python/` directory.

You can then install the module using

```
pip install -e .
```

after which you should be able to use the module in `scripts/` simply as `import juliaos`. Any changes made to the module will be reflected automatically.
