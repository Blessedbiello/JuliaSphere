# This will need access to SwarmBase types.
# Assuming SwarmBase.jl is in the parent directory (../SwarmBase.jl)
# or that types are re-exported by a higher-level module.
# For direct relative import if SwarmBase is in `julia/src/swarm/`
try
    using ...swarm.SwarmBase # Relative path from algorithms/ to swarm/
    # Or if SwarmBase is directly in src: using ..SwarmBase
    # This depends on how Swarms.jl includes SwarmBase.jl
    # Let's assume SwarmBase is accessible via the framework or a common parent.
    # For now, to ensure it compiles if run standalone for testing:
    # include("../SwarmBase.jl") # This is not ideal for module structure
    # using .SwarmBase
    # Correct approach: Swarms.jl includes SwarmBase.jl, and this file is included by Swarms.jl
    # or SwarmBase is a registered package/module.
    # For now, assuming SwarmBase types are available in the scope where this module is used.
    # If this file is `include`d by `Swarms.jl`, and `Swarms.jl` does `using .SwarmBase`, then it's fine.
    # Let's assume the types are available via `Main.JuliaOSFramework.SwarmBase` or similar.
    # For the purpose of this file, we'll assume SwarmBase is directly usable.
    # This will be resolved when _instantiate_algorithm loads it.
    # For now, to make it self-contained for thought:
    # This is a common issue with structuring Julia projects with sub-modules.
    # The `using ..SwarmBase` would be correct if `algorithms` is a sub-module of `swarm`.
    # If `Swarms.jl` does `include("algorithms/PSO.jl")`, then `SwarmBase` types are in its scope.
    # Let's write it assuming it's included by Swarms.jl which has `using .SwarmBase`.
    # So, SwarmBase.AbstractSwarmAlgorithm should be accessible.
    # No, this module will be `using`d by Swarms.jl, so it needs its own `using`.
    # The path from `julia/src/swarm/algorithms/PSO.jl` to `julia/src/swarm/SwarmBase.jl` is `../SwarmBase.jl`.
    # So, `using ..SwarmBase` if `algorithms` is a submodule of `swarm`.
    # If `algorithms` is a sibling of `swarm` under `src`, then `using ..swarm.SwarmBase`.
    # Given the current structure, `algorithms` will be a subdirectory of `swarm`.
